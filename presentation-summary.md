# 10-Minute Presentation Summary

## Slide 1: Problem Understanding (1 min)
- **Challenge**: Secure data sharing between UKHSA and DAs for non-PII communicable disease data
- **Key Requirements**: PII detection, validation, role-based access, audit trails
- **Success Criteria**: Automated, secure, scalable platform ready for engineering

## Slide 2: Technical Approach (2 mins)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: S3 triggers → Lambda validation → Glue processing
- **Security-First Design**: Macie PII scanning, SSO/MFA, role-based access
- **Serverless Strategy**: Minimal operational overhead, auto-scaling capabilities
- **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation for reproducible deployments

## Slide 3: Technology Rationale (2 mins)
- **AWS Glue**: Serverless ETL with automatic schema discovery
- **Lambda**: Cost-effective validation with sub-second response times  
- **S3**: Durable storage with lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- **Athena**: Serverless querying without infrastructure management
- **Macie**: ML-powered PII detection with healthcare-specific patterns

## Slide 4: Engineering Handover Strategy (2 mins)
- **Structured Tickets**: 9 user stories across 3 epics with clear acceptance criteria
- **Documentation Package**: Technical specs, API contracts, deployment guides
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Architecture walkthrough, security deep-dive sessions
- **Quality Gates**: Code review, security scanning, performance testing

## Slide 5: Risk Mitigation & Success Metrics (2 mins)
- **Data Protection**: Multi-bucket strategy, versioning, encryption at rest
- **Performance**: Auto-scaling Glue jobs, partition optimization for Athena
- **Cost Control**: S3 lifecycle policies, reserved capacity planning
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trails, 7-year retention, access logging

## Slide 6: Next Steps & Timeline (1 min)
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure setup (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Data processing pipeline (3 weeks)  
- **Phase 3**: Monitoring and optimization (1 week)
- **Go-Live**: Q4 2025 with phased rollout to DAs

## Key Talking Points
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressed PII concerns with automated Macie scanning
- **Scalability**: Designed for varying data frequencies (weekly to annual)
- **Developer Experience**: Clear tickets with effort estimates and dependencies
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and automated alerting
